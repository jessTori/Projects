                At first glance, it may seem that Hori is an ordinary teenage
                girl, but appearance can be deceptive. While the parents are
                working at work, the heroine is left with all the chores around
                the house, as well as taking care of her younger brother.
                Because of her constant employment, she simply does not have
                time to enjoy the delights of teenage life. Soon she meets
                Miyamura, who also does not show his real self at school. He
                seems to be an unfriendly quiet person, but outside the walls of
                the school he turns out to be a completely different person. So,
                this couple has a lot in common, and gradually they begin to get
                closer.

                Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text lead text-muted">
                The story tells about the near future, when half the world was
                captured by the British Empire. Japan does not exist in this
                version — it was conquered by Britain years ago and renamed the
                "11th sector", and the Japanese themselves are pejoratively
                called the "eleventh". The main character of the story, Lelouch
                Lamperouge, a disgraced scion of the imperial family, is exiled
                with his sister to the 11th sector, where he studies at the
                academy for local aristocrats. By chance, he finds himself
                involved in an attack by Japanese rebels on Britain. The Empire,
                which does not tolerate disobedience, immediately sends punitive
                detachments of soldiers, destroying everything in their path.
                Fleeing from the Imperials, Lelouch crosses paths with a
                mysterious green-haired girl who calls herself C.C. Being
                cornered and surrounded by soldiers, C.S. gives Lelouch a great
                gift called gias...
